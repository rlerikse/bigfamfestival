## Notes

- Compliance Gates:
  - Postgres on GCP Cloud SQL is the primary datastore; all data model changes must be documented and reviewed.
  - Audit Logging: All APIs must implement audit logging before release.
  - PII Data: PII MUST NOT be logged. If PII is required for audit, it MUST be sent to a dedicated audit table with documented access controls and rationale.
  - Distributed Tracing: All APIs must propagate the x-trace-id header before release.
  - Retry Logic: Only API calls require retry logic. Database interactions (Postgres) should not implement retry unless explicitly required for transactional integrity or error handling.

- Check items off as completed: `[x]`
- Add comments or findings inline
- Link to relevant resources or documentation
- Items are numbered sequentially for easy reference
