This file contains extracted coding conventions from connected repositories.
Use these to understand patterns across the codebase.

*No conventions have been synced yet.*

*Run `/speckit.retro --conventions` in each repository to extract patterns.*

## How to Add Conventions

1. In a repository with existing code, run:
   ```
   /speckit.retro --conventions
   ```

2. This will analyze your codebase and extract:
   - Naming conventions
   - Code patterns
   - Architecture decisions
   - Testing patterns

3. Conventions will be synced here automatically.
